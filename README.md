To start the application run the index file.  This application basically trains system to recognize objects. You can train it by clicking on train orange,train green and train blue button. This will feed in images for each of these classes. To validate click on test image button.  The application will try to identify to which class that particular image class belongs to. If you feel output is incorrect, then think why it is incorrect. It might be because of poor training, feed in more images with higher variation.

The application is used to help people learn how machine learning works. Thus we have kept sound as output.

For researchers we have given an option to record participants interaction. This will help analyze how they train the system. Again data is stored locally. 

Just to ensure you, we dont store any kind of data on any server. This application stores all the images on your local machine.
